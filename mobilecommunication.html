    The mobile communication in this case, refers to the infrastructure put in place to ensure that seamless and reliable communication goes on. These would include devices such as protocols, services, bandwidth, and portals necessary to facilitate and support the stated services. The data format is also defined at this stage. This ensures that there is no collision with other existing systems which offer the same service.

Mobile Communication
Since the media is unguided/unbounded, the overlaying infrastructure is basically radio wave-oriented. That is, the signals are carried over the air to intended devices that are capable of receiving and sending similar kinds of signals.

Mobile Hardware
Mobile hardware includes mobile devices or device components that receive or access the service of mobility. They would range from portable laptops, smartphones, tablet Pc's, Personal Digital Assistants.

Mobile Devices
These devices will have a receptor medium that is capable of sensing and receiving signals. These devices are configured to operate in full- duplex, whereby they are capable of sending and receiving signals at the same time. They don't have to wait until one device has finished communicating for the other device to initiate communications.

Above mentioned devices use an existing and established network to operate on. In most cases, it would be a wireless network.If phone companies want to live up to their oft-repeated pledge of delivering the best customer experience possible, they'll do well to hand some meaningful control of that experience to the users themselves. It can come with whatever provisos and warnings the lawyers demand, but let's stop pretending that every phone has a wonderfully specialized and customized OS that can't be improved on. Hell, the only reason people are so eager to chase down community builds of Android or figure out when Windows Phone is next being upgraded is the inadequacy of the shipping software. So if you can't write something better than the amateurs, at least get out of their way.
