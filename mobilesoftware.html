Mobile software development has one key difference when compared with web app creation: itâ€™s designed to meet the needs of mobile device users. Such apps and systems are usually created separately for iOS and Android devices. These mobile applications are called native. Designed for a particular operating system, such programs can demonstrate the advantages of unique functionality, optimised for Apple or Google Mobile platforms.

Those mobile solutions designed jointly for both platforms are called cross-platform mobile apps. Despite the difference in technical standards, the main principles of mobile development are the same. These are described below.
